# Data-in-Dating
Analyzing important features in speed dating data, and then matching algorithms like Gale Shapley and maximum weight to find the largest number of compatible matches
## How might a dating app decide who to match?

### Dating apps sell people on finding love, and different apps run differently depending on what they are trying to advertise.

#### 1. One app might advertise that it will send you your dream match.  In this case members see many others they might be interested in, but the interest may not be reciprocal.  This business model may keep clients on the app longer in hopes of their dream match finally accepting them, even though the other member may not reciprocate as often as they would like.

#### 2.  One app might advertise it produces high quality matches, where both members enjoy high levels of compatibility.  While the level of 'dreaminess' may not be as high as the first app, it can advertise more reciprocation.

In this project we will analyze speed dating data to determine which factors are most important when a person decides whether to accept a match or not.  Then we will use these important features to determine which algorithm would make the best suggestions, depending on whether we are using dating app model 1 or 2.

The <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/speed.dating/">data</a> we use was compiled by Columbia Business School professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar for their paper<a href= "https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/867/datingFULL-EK1.pdf#:~:text=We%20study%20dating%20behavior%20using%20data%20from%20a,while%20femaleselectivity%20is%20strongly%20increasing%20in%20group%20size"> Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment. </a>  They collected data from 21 speed dating events to analyze their decisions.
